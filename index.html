        <p>Welcome To Preston Manor Lower School! This School is in wembley.I hope that you have all had a wonderful summer holiday and that your children are relaxed, recharged and ready for the new school year. The children all put in another great effort last year and were rewarded with fantastic success. The children have returned to school with such enthusiasm and are all looking very smart in their uniforms. Thank you to all parents for helping your children to look so smart and wear their uniforms with such pride.Thank you to the PTA and their helpers for all the wonderful events that they ran last year, all the money that their fund-raising brought into the school and the very generous donations that they made for the benefit of the children. I am especially thankful for the donation that the PTA made towards the year 6 leavers gifts and donations towards workshops  that our children participated in last year. The PTA AGM will be on Thursday 26th September  from 9:00am in the school hall. If you are able to donate some of your expertise or time to the PTA, please could I encourage you to attend this meeting. Alternatively, there is a yellow PTA box in the school reception where you could write your name and contact details and  a member of the PTA will ring you.</p>
